## :star: *An aspiring Software Developer* :star:

I'm 21 years old and originally from the south of Brazil. After finishing high school in 2018, I came to London looking for better opportunities and started my work experience in hospitality, where I learned and honed my social skills.

In the meantime, I started to learn how to program by myself with some online platforms and I felt even more encouraged to start a career in technology. Now I'm looking for an opportunity to improve my coding skills to gain experience in the tech field.
